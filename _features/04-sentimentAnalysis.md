Sentiment Analysis was conducted using the Python package [TextBlob](https://textblob.readthedocs.io/en/dev/) via the [Pattern Analyzer](http://www.clips.ua.ac.be/pattern). The package returns a polarity and subjectivity measure.

- Polarity: positive or negative connotation, value between [-1,1]
- Subjectivity: subjective or objective, value between [0,1]
