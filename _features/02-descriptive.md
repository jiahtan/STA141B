 To see if there was a “golden period” of music, where lots of songs got released that eventually ended up on this top 100 list, we examned how many songs end up in the top 100 list for each year. We can see many songs landing between the 70s and early 80s, follow by a period of inacitivty and a slight resurgeance prior to the 20s. Entering into the 20s is another period of low and spikes again around 2010.

Getting a frequency count on the number of artists that appear on the list more than once, we only got 7 artists total. (We double count artists that share collaborations)

As a different approach to answering ‘when were the good songs released’, we generated a scoring system. To contrast between the barplot of song by year and the score plot, we can see that the 80’s period has been diminished some bit, and appears to be tied with 2011, which is interesting, since 2011 has 4 hit songs, and 1980-1983 had around 5-6 hits each. (Note: higher index -> better performance on top 100 chart).
