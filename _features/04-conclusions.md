### __What We Found__

Our analysis revealed that love is very common topic amongst the top songs, with the most common phrase being ‘I love you’. Towards the 90’s the use of the word ‘love’ reached it’s peak, as did the similarities of yearly top 100 songs to the top 100 songs of all time. 

It may be subjective to figure out when a “Golden Era” of music existed, but by balancing out quantities with list rankings, we can see that the late 1970’s/early 1980s may be the top contender.

When analyzing interesting content words and phrases, we can see that a lot of the words are simple and short (i.e. “yeah”, “hot”, “wanna”, “good”). We couldn’t draw conclusions simply from the top 100 songs of all time on what makes a song “popular”, because they generally appeared unique (in terms of song attributes from Spotify).

### __What We Learned__

Our initial analysis was conducted with only the lyrics of the top 100 songs of all time. We learned that this sample size was too small to generate a thorough analysis of trends over more than 50 years. 

We later imported all the top 100 hits from 1958 to 2015 from someone’s website, and generated the Spotify features for most of them (some of the songs weren’t found on Spotify). However, after looking at plots of all 5100 songs versus the Spotify attributes, there were no noticeable trends and no correlation.

We realized that sticking with the top 100 hits of all time, we can see clearer what were the noticeable trends of what made a song ‘popular’ during an era. Many time analyses were performed, focusing on the cream of the crop from the years. Although our data may have been limited, it allowed us to pursue greater detailed insights and be selective about the top attributes for that year.

Nonetheless, more data exploration may result in more interesting findings if we could venture into the larger data set. Some ideas include:

Some ideas include:

- Word clouds per decade, compare/contrast with our existing limited word clouds
- Use ngrams to find out what were the catchy cultural phrases (“radical”, “gnarly”, etc.) over time
- Contrast features from top hits in the top 10 for a year vs. the lower ranked songs
- Predict rank based on a songs attributes
- Predict decade by a song’s lyrics
