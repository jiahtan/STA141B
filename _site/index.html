Using Billboard's top 100 songs of all time for their 55th anniversary, we want to see if we can identify people's music tastes through time by examining different characteristics of the songs in this list.</h3> </div> </div> </header> <div class="container"> <main> <hr id='/features/01-dataInfo'> <section> <img class='pull-right' src=''> <h2>Our <span>Data</span></h2> <div class='lead'><p>To perform our analysis, we first scraped the list of 100 songs from <a href="http://www.billboard.com/articles/list/2155531/the-hot-100-all-time-top-songs">Billboard</a> for the song name, year, and artist.</p> <p>Then we turn to <a href="http://www.songlyrics.com/">songlyrics</a> to retrieve the lyrics for each song. Out of the 100 songs, we were unable to retrieve lyrics for 4 songs due to collaboration between the artists, the song title not matching, or the title from Billboard was a combination of two songs. For these special cases, we scrape individual sites.</p> <p>Besides getting just the lyrics, we also used <a href="https://developer.spotify.com/web-api/get-audio-features/">Spotify’s API</a> to extract audio features of the songs. For a detail description of the features, clicked the spotify link above.</p> <div class="images"> <div class="imgContainer"> <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2b/Billboard_Hot_100_logo.jpg" height="200" width="200" /> </div> <div class="imgContainer"> <img src="http://vorm7.weebly.com/uploads/1/6/4/5/16458916/5896387_orig.png" height="250" width="250" /> </div> <div class="imgContainer"> <img src="http://az616578.vo.msecnd.net/files/2016/06/14/636015184339992485-1040107779_spotify.jpg" height="200" width="200" /> </div> </div> </div> </section> <hr id='/features/02-descriptive'> <section> <img class='pull-left' src=''> <h2>Visualizing <span>Data Characteristic</span></h2> <div class='lead'><h3 id="distribution-of-the-songs-across-time">Distribution of the Songs Across Time</h3> <iframe src="./assets/plots/songByYear.html" width="650" height="450" style="border:none;" align="middle"></iframe> <p>To see if there was a “golden period” of music, where lots of songs got released that eventually ended up on this top 100 list, we examned how many songs end up in the top 100 list for each year. We can see many songs landing between the 70s and early 80s, follow by a period of inacitivty and a slight resurgeance prior to the 20s. Entering into the 20s is another period of low and spikes again around 2010.</p> <h3 id="repeated-artists">Repeated Artists</h3> <p><img src="./assets/images/artistRepeat.jpg" /></p> <p>Getting a frequency count on the number of artists that appear on the list more than once, we only got 7 artists total.

To contrast between the barplot of song by year and the score plot, we can see that the 80’s period has been diminished some bit, and appears to be tied with 2011, which is interesting, since 2011 has 4 hit songs, and 1980-1983 had around 5-6 hits each. (Note: higher index -&gt; better performance on top 100 chart).</p> <p><img src="./assets/images/2011Songs.JPG" /></p> <h3 id="spotify-audio-features">Spotify Audio Features</h3> <iframe src="./assets/plots/AudioFeaturePlot.html" width="1000" height="600" style="border:none;" align="middle"></iframe> <p>Some interesting patterns that we noted in the audio features is that for valence and energy, there is a dip between the 1985 and 1990. This may indicate a period of sadder songs hitting the charts.</p> </div> </section> <hr id='/features/03-ngrams'> <section> <img class='pull-right' src=''> <h2>N-Gram and Density Measures <span>Analysis</span></h2> <div class='lead'> </div> </section> <hr id='/features/04-sentimentAnalysis'> <section> <img class='pull-left' src=''> <h2>Sentiment <span>Analysis</span></h2> <div class='lead'><p>Sentiment Analysis was conducted using the Python package <a href="https://textblob.readthedocs.io/en/dev/">TextBlob</a> via the <a href="http://www.clips.ua.ac.be/pattern">Pattern Analyzer</a>.

However, there may be inaccuracy in the classification, because as we can see the most negative song is ‘Call Me Maybe’ by Carly Rae Jepsen, which we know for sure is not a negative song. However, since the lyrics repeats ‘so bad’ and ‘crazy’ many times, it has a negative score.</p> <ul> <li>Subjectivity: subjective or objective, value between [0,1]</li> </ul> <iframe src="./assets/plots/subjectivity.html" width="650" height="450" style="border:none" align="middle"></iframe> <p>From the plot of subjectivity against time, we see that all of the songs are moderately subjective, siginifying the meaning of the words depend on the person.</p> </div> </section> <hr> </main> <footer> <div class='row'> <div class='col-lg-12'> <p>Copyright &copy; STA 141B Final Project 2017</p> </div> </div> </footer> </div> <script src='/one-page-wonder-jekyll//assets/app.js'></script> </body> </html>
